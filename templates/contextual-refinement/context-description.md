# Context Description

This document captures the **contextual interpretation** required by CRISP-TAI to support
trustworthiness-related reasoning at the governance and design level.

It is intended to be created and maintained early in the lifecycle and revisited whenever
significant contextual changes occur (e.g., regulatory updates, deployment changes, or
operational feedback).

This artefact primarily supports **Contextual Refinement rules CR.1, CR.4, and CR.5**.

## 1. System overview

Provide a concise description of the AI system under development.

- System name:
- High-level purpose:
- Intended users and beneficiaries:
- Decision or action supported by the system:
- Deployment environment (organisational, technical, geographical):

---

## 2. Organisational context

Describe the organisational setting in which the system is developed and operated.

- Owning organisation(s):
- Participating teams or units:
- External partners or third parties:
- Existing governance structures (committees, review boards, roles):

---

## 3. Legal and regulatory context

Identify applicable legal and regulatory constraints.

- Applicable regulations (e.g., AI Act, GDPR, sector-specific regulation):
- Jurisdiction(s):
- Compliance obligations relevant to the system:
- Known regulatory uncertainties or interpretative challenges:

---

## 4. Social and ethical context

Describe relevant social, ethical, or societal considerations.

- Affected groups or stakeholders:
- Potential social impact (benefits and risks):
- Ethical concerns specific to the use context:
- Power asymmetries or dependency relationships:

---

## 5. Operational context

Describe operational characteristics that may influence trustworthiness.

- Data sources and data providers:
- Model type(s) and level of autonomy:
- Integration with other systems:
- Expected operational lifetime:
- Monitoring and maintenance constraints:

---

## 6. Trustworthiness priorities

Document initial priorities among trustworthiness dimensions.

For each relevant dimension, indicate:
- Priority level (e.g., high / medium / low)
- Rationale for prioritisation
- Known trade-offs with other dimensions

Example:

| Dimension | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Lawfulness | High | Regulated deployment environment |
| Fairness | Medium | Indirect impact on users |
| Transparency | High | Human oversight required |

---

## 7. Contextual assumptions

Explicitly document assumptions underlying trustworthiness-related decisions.

- Assumptions about system use:
- Assumptions about user behaviour:
- Assumptions about data quality or stability:
- Assumptions about organisational practices:

---

## 8. Revision triggers

Specify conditions under which this context description must be revisited.

- Regulatory changes:
- Deployment context changes:
- New data sources or use cases:
- Observed operational issues:
- Stakeholder feedback:

---

## 9. Versioning and responsibility

- Document owner:
- Responsible role:
- Date created:
- Last revision date:
- Revision history summary:

---

## Notes

This document is a **living artefact**. Its purpose is not to freeze context, but to
make contextual interpretations explicit, traceable, and revisable throughout the
system lifecycle.
