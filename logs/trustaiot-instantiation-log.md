# Instantiation Log — TrustAIoT Platform

This log documents how **CRISP-TAI** was instantiated at the **platform level** in the
TrustAIoT scenario, capturing when and why Contextual Refinement (CR) and Functional
Refinement (FR) rules were applied during system evolution.

The purpose of this artefact is to provide **process-level evidence** of execution-based
validation, rather than to report implementation details or performance results.

---

## 1. Instantiation scope

- Platform: TrustAIoT (Trustworthy AIoT Platform)
- Scope: Platform-wide governance and continuous operation
- Instantiation phase: Initial deployment and early operational phase
- Responsible body: Platform Governance Board

---

## 2. Applied Contextual Refinement (CR) rules

The following Contextual Refinement rules were applied:

- **CR.1 — Context Interpretation**  
  Used to characterise the edge–fog–cloud architecture, heterogeneous IoT devices,
  and long-lived operational nature of the platform.

- **CR.2 — Responsibility Allocation**  
  Applied to distribute trustworthiness responsibilities across platform owner,
  platform teams, project teams, and compliance actors.

- **CR.3 — Principle Prioritisation**  
  Used to prioritise lawfulness, robustness, and explicability at platform level,
  reflecting regulatory exposure and human-centric requirements.

- **CR.4 — Assumption Documentation**  
  Applied to document assumptions about device lifecycle management,
  project adherence to platform guidelines, and regulatory stability.

- **CR.5 — Context Revision Triggers**  
  Defined triggers for revisiting contextual interpretations, including regulatory
  updates, platform incidents, and onboarding of new device classes.

## 3. Applied Functional Refinement (FR) rules

The following Functional Refinement rules were activated:

- **FR.1 — Artefact Derivation**  
  Resulted in the creation of platform-wide compliance guidelines,
  explainability guidelines, and lifecycle management policies.

- **FR.2 — Decision Traceability**  
  Used to link trustworthiness decisions to concrete artefacts and responsible
  roles across platform layers.

- **FR.3 — Operational Adjustment**  
  Activated when monitoring and audit signals required changes to platform
  procedures or project onboarding conditions.

- **FR.4 — Iterative Feedback Integration**  
  Enabled feedback from audits and user communities to trigger revisions of
  assumptions and priorities.

- **FR.6 — Continuity Enforcement**  
  Ensured that trustworthiness artefacts and responsibilities remained active
  across platform evolution and organisational changes.

---

## 4. Key instantiation outcomes

- Trustworthiness concerns were managed **at platform level**, rather than
  delegated entirely to individual AIoT projects.
- Responsibilities and escalation paths were clarified across organisational layers.
- Monitoring and feedback mechanisms enabled continuous governance without
  introducing static compliance checkpoints.

---

## 5. Lessons learned

- Platform-level instantiation requires explicit separation between
  project-specific and platform-wide trustworthiness concerns.
- Long-lived AIoT systems benefit from early definition of revision triggers,
  as assumptions become invalid over time.
- CRISP-TAI artefacts provided a shared language across technical,
  governance, and compliance teams.

This instantiation log is illustrative and focuses on **process execution and refinement**.
It does not replace the detailed architectural or technical descriptions provided
in the TrustAIoT publication.
