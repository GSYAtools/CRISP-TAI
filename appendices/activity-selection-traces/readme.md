# Activity Selection Trace — CRISP-TAI

This appendix documents how **trustworthiness-related activities were selected,
adapted, and justified for each lifecycle phase** during the construction of CRISP-TAI.

The material is derived from the detailed, dimension-by-dimension analysis
presented in the earlier CRISP-DM refinement study and is provided here as
**technical traceability material** for practitioners and reviewers.

This appendix does **not** introduce new requirements or rules.
It complements the CRISP-TAI paper by making explicit the rationale behind
phase-level activity selection.
