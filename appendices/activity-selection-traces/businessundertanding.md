# Business Understanding — Activity Selection Trace

This document explains how trustworthiness-related activities were selected
and refined for the **Business Understanding** phase.

## Rationale
Activities in this phase focus on:
- Early interpretation of legal and organisational constraints
- Explicit allocation of responsibilities
- Definition of trustworthiness priorities

These activities support CR.1–CR.3 and enable a shift-left integration
of governance concerns.

## Selected activities
- Context interpretation and scoping
- Stakeholder and responsibility identification
- Trustworthiness prioritisation and trade-off discussion

## Traceability
Each activity can be traced to gaps identified in CRISP-DM refinements
and is reflected in the templates provided under `/templates/contextual-refinement/`.
