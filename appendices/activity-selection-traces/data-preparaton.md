# Data Preparation — Activity Selection Trace

This document describes the activity selection for the **Data Preparation** phase.

## Rationale
At this phase, trustworthiness is affected by:
- Data transformations
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Privacy-preserving processing

## Selected activities
- Documentation of transformation rationale
- Traceability of inclusion/exclusion decisions

## Traceability
Activities were selected to ensure that preprocessing decisions remain
inspectable and revisable, supporting FR.1 and FR.2.
