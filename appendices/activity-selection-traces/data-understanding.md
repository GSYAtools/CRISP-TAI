# Data Understanding — Activity Selection Trace

This document describes the activity selection for the **Data Understanding** phase.

## Rationale
Trustworthiness concerns at this phase relate to:
- Data provenance and lineage
- Assumptions about data quality and representativeness

## Selected activities
- Explicit documentation of data-related assumptions
- Early assessment of data governance constraints

## Traceability
These activities address limitations observed in existing CRISP-DM refinements,
where data trustworthiness was often treated implicitly or post-hoc.
