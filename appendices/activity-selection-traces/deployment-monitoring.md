# Deployment & Monitoring — Activity Selection Trace

This document explains the activity selection for the **Continuous Deployment & Monitoring** phase.

## Rationale
Trustworthiness in this phase is dynamic and operational.

## Selected activities
- Continuous monitoring of trustworthiness signals
- Explicit feedback and revision mechanisms

## Traceability
These activities address a key limitation of CRISP-DM, where deployment
was often treated as terminal rather than iterative.
