# Example — Trustworthy AIoT Platform (TrustAIoT)

This example illustrates how **CRISP-TAI** can be instantiated at the
**platform level** for the governance, evolution, and long-term operation
of **trustworthy AIoT ecosystems**.

The example is derived from the framework presented in  
*TrustAIoT: A framework for building trustworthy AIoT platforms*,
and reinterprets that work from the perspective of **CRISP-TAI as a lifecycle
and process-oriented engineering model**.

---

## Context overview

The system is an **AIoT platform** designed to host and support multiple
AI-enabled IoT projects over time.

Key characteristics include:
- Edge–fog–cloud architecture
- Heterogeneous devices and resource constraints
- Long-lived operation with evolving regulations
- Multiple stakeholders and hosted projects

Trustworthiness must therefore be managed **at platform level**, not only
at the level of individual AI models or applications.

---

## Stakeholders and roles

- **Platform Owner**  
  Organisation responsible for platform strategy and governance.

- **Platform Teams**  
  Architecture, infrastructure, and integration teams managing the platform layers.

- **Project Teams**  
  Teams deploying AIoT applications on top of the platform.

- **Compliance and Policy Teams**  
  Actors responsible for regulatory alignment, audits, and policy updates.

- **End Users and Communities**  
  Individuals and organisations interacting with AIoT applications.

## Trustworthiness concerns

Based on the TrustAIoT framework, the dominant
trustworthiness concerns include:

- Lifecycle governance across edge–fog–cloud layers
- Responsibility allocation across teams and layers
- Continuous risk assessment and monitoring
- Explainability, transparency, and accountability
- Sustainability and ethical impact over long-term operation

These concerns motivate a strong integration of **Contextual** and
**Functional Refinement** mechanisms.

## Application of CRISP-TAI

CRISP-TAI is applied to structure trustworthiness management across:

- Platform design and evolution
- Deployment and integration of new projects
- Continuous monitoring and governance
- Revision of policies, procedures, and assumptions

This example focuses on **process-level artefacts**, not on architectural
specifications or BPMN diagrams.

---

## Purpose of the example

This example demonstrates how CRISP-TAI:

- Scales from project-level to platform-level governance
- Supports long-term trustworthiness management
- Aligns technical, organisational, and ethical concerns

It is illustrative and does not replace the detailed architectural
descriptions provided in the TrustAIoT paper.
