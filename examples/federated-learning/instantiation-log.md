This file is a **pointer** to the canonical execution log for this example.

 **Canonical log location:**

Please refer to the file above for the complete execution-based trace documenting
the application of CRISP-TAI refinement rules in the Federated Learning scenario.

This pointer avoids duplication and ensures that execution logs remain
centralised and consistent.
