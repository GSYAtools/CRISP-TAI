# Contributing to CRISP-TAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CRISP-TAI technical artefact.

This repository accompanies the CRISP-TAI research article and provides
practical engineering artefacts, templates, and example instantiations to
support the adoption of the CRISP-TAI process model in real-world settings.

Contributions are welcome, provided they align with the scope and principles
outlined below.

---

## Scope of contributions

This repository accepts contributions that:

- Extend or refine **engineering templates** (CR / FR artefacts)
- Add **example instantiations** demonstrating how CRISP-TAI can be applied
  in concrete contexts
- Improve **practitioner-oriented documentation**
- Clarify or enhance **traceability, evaluability, or governance-related artefacts**

Contributions should focus on **process-level support**, not on specific tools,
algorithms, or metrics.

---

## What is out of scope

To preserve the integrity and intent of CRISP-TAI, the following types of
contributions are **out of scope** and will not be accepted:

- Certification schemes or compliance checklists
- Automated auditing or trustworthiness scoring tools
- Prescriptive or normative policy frameworks
- Domain-specific hard-coded metrics or thresholds
- Implementations that replace human judgement with automated decisions

CRISP-TAI is designed to support **reasoned decision-making and evaluability**,
not automated compliance or normative enforcement.

## Types of contributions

### 1. Templates and artefacts

Contributions may include:

- New or improved templates in `/templates`
- Additional traceability or documentation artefacts
- Enhancements that improve clarity, reuse, or adaptability

Each template contribution should include:
- A short description of its purpose
- An example of how it would be used in practice
- Clear alignment with CR or FR refinement mechanisms

---

### 2. Example instantiations

Contributions to `/examples` are particularly welcome.

Examples should:
- Describe the **context and system scope**
- Indicate which **CR and FR rules** were applied
- Include representative artefacts (anonymised or synthetic)
- Document decisions, assumptions, and revision triggers

Examples do not need to be complete implementations.
Their purpose is to demonstrate **instantiability and practical reasoning**.

---

### 3. Documentation

Improvements to documentation in `/docs` may include:
- Clarifications for practitioners
- Step-by-step walkthroughs
- Explanations of how rules are applied in practice
- Notes on governance integration or organisational adoption

Documentation should complement the article, not replicate it.

## Contribution process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch describing your contribution.
3. Make your changes following the repository structure.
4. Open a pull request with:
   - A clear description of the contribution
   - The motivation for the change
   - Any relevant context or examples

Where applicable, please reference the CR or FR rules that your contribution
relates to.

---

## Review criteria

Contributions will be reviewed based on:

- Alignment with the CRISP-TAI process model
- Clarity and usefulness for practitioners
- Preservation of a non-normative, process-oriented approach
- Avoidance of hard-coded metrics or automated judgement

---

## Use of prior material

If your contribution is derived from prior publications, industrial projects,
or internal documentation:
- Ensure that you have the right to share the material
- Anonymise sensitive information
- Clearly indicate the origin of the artefacts

---

## Questions and discussion

If you are unsure whether a contribution fits the scope, please open an issue
for discussion before submitting a pull request.
