# Changelog

This changelog documents **structural and artefact-level changes** to the CRISP-TAI
technical repository. It is intentionally lightweight and focuses on changes that
affect **practical adoption and reuse**.

The associated research article remains the authoritative source for conceptual and
methodological evolution.
